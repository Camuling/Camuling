- 👋  Hi, I’m Daniel Aleix (@Camuling)
  
- 👀  I’m interested in software development, particularly in web and mobile app development.
      I'm fascinated by creating elegant and efficient solutions to real-world problems through code.

🌱   I’m currently learning about machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
     I believe that these technologies are shaping the future of software engineering,
     and I'm excited to explore how they can be integrated into various applications.

💞️   I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to education and skill development. 
     I'm passionate about giving back to the community and helping others learn and grow as software engineers.

📫   You can reach me via email at tyger-danny@outlook.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-aleixo-21a2631a9/.
      Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss coding, projects, or anything related to software engineering!
